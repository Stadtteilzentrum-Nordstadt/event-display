## Running



## Configuration

There is a `config.toml` to configure every important aspect of the app. The path for this file can be set using the `CONFIG_PATH` environment variable. If this variable is not set, the app will look for a `config.toml` in the current working directory.

Here is an example configuration:

```toml
[frontend]
# The title of the page displayed at the top of the page
title = "Veranstaltungen in der BÃ¼rgerschule"
# The url of the logo displayed in the top right corner
icon = "/logo.png"
# The theme color, used for everything colored in the app
themeColor = "#EC6500"
# the time (in seconds) for scrolling to the next page of events when pagination is happening because of a lot of events (optional, default: 10)
scrollInterval = 10

[calendar]
# The timezone of the calendar
timeZone = "Europe/Berlin"
# The interval (in seconds) to refresh loaded events from the calendar
refreshInterval = 300
# The calendars to load events from
# name: The name of the room the calendar is for (displayed below the title of the event)
# url: The url of the calendar (found as the "Internal URL" in the nextcloud calendar settings)
# location: The location of the room the calendar is for, displayed on the right of the event list (optional, default: "")
# hideName: If the name of the room should be hidden in the event list (below the title) (optional, default: false)
calendars = [
    { name = "Raum A", url = "https://cloud.example.de/remote.php/dav/calendars/kalendar/raum-a/", location = "2. OG", hideName = false },
    { name = "Raum B", url = "https://cloud.example.de/remote.php/dav/calendars/kalendar/raum-b/", location = "2. OG", hideName = false },
]
# events that contain this keyword in their title will be ignored and not shown in the event list
ignoreKeywords = ["!intern!", "!privat!"]
# time in seconds after which an event is considered to be in the past and will be removed from the event list
timeout = 0
# the auth information for the nextcloud instance (app password), the user must have read access to the calendars specified above
# type: The type of authentication, currently only "basic" is supported (optional)
auth = { type = "basic", username = "kalendar", password = "abcdefg" }
```
